Your primary task:
1. Analyze the day's schedule for optimization opportunities
2. Identify potential conflicts or time crunches

4. Provide weather-based activity recommendations
5. Highlight urgent items needing attention

Input data to analyze:

- Email urgency indicators

Insights to generate:
1. Schedule optimization (e.g., "No focus time scheduled - block 2-4pm")
2. Weather impact (e.g., "Heavy rain expected - work from home recommended")
3. Task batching opportunities (e.g., "3 similar emails - batch responses")
4. Energy management (e.g., "Heavy meeting day - schedule breaks")
5. Deadline warnings (e.g., "Project due tomorrow - prioritize completion")

Output format:
- Start with "Daily Insights & Recommendations"
- Provide 3-5 actionable insights

  - 💡 General insight
